# Introduction
#### Flow : HLL -> ALP -> Binary -> (HDL) -> GDS
- HLL -> High-level language (c, c++) 
- ALP -> Assembly level program
- HDL -> Hardware Description Language
- GDS -> Graphic Data System (layout)

###### The Hardware needs to understand what the Application software is saying it to do.This relation can be eshtablished by System Software

____System Software____
- OS: Operating System: Handles IO, memory allocation, Low-level system function
- Compiler: Convert the input to hardware-dependent instruction
- Assembler: Convert the instructions provided by the compiler to Binary format
- HDL: A program that understands the Binary pattern and maps it to a netlist
- GDS: Layout

## 1. Create a simple C program That calculates sum from 1 to N -> sum1toN.c

____Compile it using C compiler____
```
gcc sum1toN.c -o 1toN.o
./1toN.o
```
-o allows you to name your output file

____compile using riscv compiler and view the output____
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o 1toN.o sum1toN.c
spike pk 1toN.o
```
For reducing the number of instructions in ALP 
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o 1toN.o sum1toN.c
```

- -Onumber : level of optimisation required
- -mabi : specifies the ABI (Application Binary Interface) to be used during code generation according to the requirements
- -march : specifies target architecture

______We can check the different options available for all these fields using the commands______ 
go to the directory where riscv64-unkonwn-elf is present
- -O1 : ``` riscv64-unkonwn-elf --help=optimizer```
- -mabi : ```riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --target-help```
- -march : ```riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --target-help```

____To view the disassembled ALP code____
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d 1toN.o
```
If you want to have less ALP code
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d 1toN.o | less
```
- run the above command in another terminal to follow the below process 

____To debug the ALP generated by the compiler____
```
spike -d pk 1toN.o
```

- until pc 0 100b0 : the compiler debugs the ALP code until ```100b0```
- press ENTER: debug next instruction and successive ENTER debugs successive instructions 
- reg 0 a0 : shows content of register a0 
- q: quit the debug process
- you can clearly observe in the above picture that the value of the register is changing after debugging instruction

## 2.Signed and Unsigned Numbers
- RISC-V doubleword can represent 0 to (2^64 - 1) unsigned numbers or positive numbers.
- RISC-V doubleword can represent 0 to (2^63 - 1) positive and 1 to (-2^63) negative numbers.
- Right a C program for displaying the highest and lowest numbers of unsigned and signed.
```
highlow.c
```
